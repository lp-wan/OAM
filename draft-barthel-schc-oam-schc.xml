  <abstract>

  <t>This document describes how SCHC can be used to efficiently perform basic Operation, Administration and Maintenance (OAM)
    on Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs)
    by compressing ICMPv6/IPv6 headers,
    or by shielding the LPWAN network and the Device from undesirable ICMPv6 traffic.</t>

<t>This document specifies additional behavior for SCHC <xref target="RFC8724"/> and
extends the YANG Data Model defined in <xref target="RFC9363"/>.</t>

<name>Introduction</name>


    <t>With IP protocols now generalizing to constrained networks, users expect to be able to
	Operate, Administer and Maintain (OAM) <xref target="RFC6291"/> such networks 
    with the familiar tools and protocols they already use on less constrained networks.</t>

    <t>However, this requires a little care, because OAM traffic adds load to the network,
	and LPWANs could easily be overwhelmed by it.
	LPWANs’ salient characteristics are described in <xref target="RFC8376"/>.</t>

	<t>This document specifies ways to compress such OAM traffic over LPWANs, or to eschew it altogether.</t>

    <t>OAM uses specific messages sent into the data plane to probe a network.
    Most often, these messages do not carry meaningful data.
    Instead, network metrics are inferred from analysing the OAM traffic.</t>

    <t>For example, such traffic is used</t>

    <ul>
      <li>to detect if a host is up or down,</li> 
      <li>to measure the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and its variation over time,</li>
      <li>to determine avalaible bandwidth, or</li>
      <li>to learn the path used by packets to reach a destination.</li>
    </ul>

    <t>The primitive functionalities of OAM are achieved with the ICMPv6 protocol <xref target="RFC4443"/>.
	ICMPv6 messages are transported over IPv6 <xref target="RFC8200"/>.</t>

<t>ICMPv6 defines a generic message format, used to inform the source of IPv6 packets of errors during packet delivery..</t>
<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> instantiates 4 such error messages:
Destination Unreachable, Packet Too Big, Time Exceeded and Parameter Problem.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> also defines the Echo Request and Echo Reply messages, which provide support for the ping application.</t>

<t>Other ICMPv6 messages are defined in other RFCs, such as an extended format of the same messages <xref target="RFC4884"/>
and other messages used by the Neighbor Discovery Protocol <xref target="RFC4861"/>.</t>

<t>This document focuses on using Static Context Header Compression (SCHC) to compress <xref target="RFC4443"/> messages that need to 
be transmitted over the LPWAN network, and on having the LPWAN gateway proxying the Device to save it the unwanted traffic.
More specifically, this document describes recommended compression of ICMPv6/IPv6 messages (including header fields and structured payload)
     and extends SCHC by specifying new surrogate behavior, addressing four scenarios:</t>

    <ul>
      <li>OAM reachability messages coming from the internet: the core SCHC acts as a 
          proxy and may decide to respond by itself, thereby acting as a surrogate to the Device.</li>

      <li>OAM messages initiated by LPWAN Devices: they can be anticipated and sent in their SCHC-compressed form like regular Device traffic.</li>

      <li>OAM error messages returned from the internet after an LPWAN Device transmission. The core SCHC forwards
          a compressed version of the error message to the Device.</li>

      <li>traffic coming from the internet that would generate an error at the Device: if it can detect the situation,
	      the core SCHC responds with an ICMPv6 error message, acting as a surrogate to the Device.</li>

    </ul>

<name>Use cases</name>

<t>In the LPWAN architecture, we can distinguish the following cases:</t>

<ul spacing="normal">
  <li>The Device is the originator of an Echo Request message, and therefore the destination of the Echo 
  Reply message. 
      These messages are compressed/decompressed by the device and by the core SCHC using SCHC rules that match the ICMPv6 fields.</li>
  <li>The Device is the destination of an Echo Request message, and therefore the purported source 
  of an Echo Reply message. 
      The core SCHC can either forward the SCHC-compressed Echo Request message to the Device,
	  or proxy the Device by answering with an Echo Reply message on its behalf, in order to spare
      the constrained link.
      The proxy answer can be related to the Device observed activity.</li>
  <li>The Device is the (purported) source of an ICMP error message, mainly in response to an incorrect
      incoming IPv6
      message. In this case, as much as possible, the core SCHC should act as
      a proxy and originate the ICMP Destination Unreachable message, so that the Device and the LPWAN
      network are protected from this unwanted traffic.</li>
  <li>the Device is the destination of the ICMPv6 message, mainly in response to a
      packet sent by the Device to the network that generates an error. In this case, we want the ICMPv6 message
      to reach the Device,
      and this document describes in <xref target="ErrMsgCompr"/> what SCHC compression should be applied.</li>
</ul>

<t>These cases are further described in <xref target="DetailedBehavior"/>.</t>

<t>If we assume that one rule will be devoted to compressing Echo Request messages, then Type and Code are known 
in the rule to be 128 and 0 and can therefore be elided with the not-sent CDA.</t>

<t>Checksum can be reconstructed with the compute-checksum CDA and therefore is not transmitted.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> states that Identifier and Sequence Number are meant to
“aid in matching Echo Replies to this Echo Request” and that they “may be zero”.
Data is “zero or more bytes of arbitrary data”.</t>

<t>For constrained devices or networks, we recommend that Identifier be zero, Sequence Number 
be a counter on 3 bits, and Data be zero bytes (absent). Therefore, Identifier is elided with the 
not-sent CDA, Sequence Number is transmitted on 3 bits with the LSB CDA and no Data is transmitted.</t>

<t>The transmission cost of the Echo Request message is therefore the size of the Rule Id + 3 bits. The rule ID length
can be chosen to avoid adding padding. </t>

<t>When the destination receives the Echo Request message, it will respond back with a Echo Reply message.
This message bears the same format as the Echo Request message but with Type = 129
(see <xref target="Fig-ICMPv6-Echo-Request"/>).</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> states that the Identifier, Sequence Number and Data fields of the Echo Reply 
message shall contain the same values as the invoking Echo Request message. Therefore, a rule shall be used 
similar to that used for compressing the Echo Request message.</t>

<!--
  <t>TODO: how about a shared rule for Echo Request and Echo Reply with an LSB(1) CDA on the Type field? Or exploiting the Up/Down direction field in the rule?</t>
-->

<section anchor="rule-example" title="Rule example">

<t>The following rule gives an example of a SCHC compression.
The type can be elided if the direction is taken into account.
Identifier is ignored and generated as 0 at decompression.
This implies that only one single ping can be launched at any given time on a device.
Finally, only the least significant 8 bits of the sequence number are sent on the LPWAN,
allowing a serie of 255 consecutive pings.</t>

<t>If the Device is ping’ed (i.e., is the destination of an Echo Request message), the 
device receives the compress message and generate an Echo. In that case, the fields
sequence number and identifier cannot be compressed if the source is not aware of 
the compression scheme.</t>

<t> But the default behavior is to avoid
propagating the Echo Request message over the LPWAN.</t>

<!--This is the recommended behavior with the Code 0 (default value) of the Echo Request message.-->

<t>This is done by proxying the ping request on the core SCHC.
This requires to introduce a new processing when the rule is selected.
The selection of a compression rule triggers the compression and sends the SCHC
packet to the other end. Specifying an Action, change this behavior.
In our case, being processed by the compressor, the packet description is processed by a ping proxy.
Since the rule is used for the selection, so CDAs are not necessary and set to "not-sent".</t>

<t>The ping-proxy takes a parameter in second, gives the interval during which the device is considered active.  
During this interval, the proxy-ping echoes ping requests, after this duration, the ping request will be discarded. </t>

<t>The resulting behavior is shown on <xref target="Fig-ICMPv6-ping"/> and described below:</t>

<t>As stated in <xref target="RFC4443"/>, a node should generate an ICMPv6 message in response to an
IPv6 packet that is malformed or which cannot be processed due to some incorrect field value.</t>

<t>The general intent of this document is to spare both the Device and the LPWAN network this un-necessary traffic.
The incorrect packets should be caught at the core SCHC and the ICMPv6 notification should be sent back from there.</t>

<t><xref target="Fig-ICMPv6-up"/> shows an example of an IPv6 packet trying to reach a Device. </t>

<!-- Let’s assume that the port number used
as destination port is not “known” (needs better definition) from the core SCHC. 
-->

<t>Let's assume that no rule matches the incoming packet (i.e. there is no co-compression rule)</t>

<t>Instead of sending the packet over
the LPWAN and having this packet rejected by the Device, the core SCHC issues
an ICMPv6 error message “Destination Unreachable” (Type 1) with Code 1 (“Port Unreachable”) on behalf of the Device.</t>

<t>In that case the SCHC C/D MAY act as a router (i.e. it MUST have a routable IPv6 address to generate
an ICMPv6 message). When compressing a packet containing an IPv6 header, no compression rules are found and:
* if a rule contains some extension headers, a parameter problem may be generated (type 4),
* no rule contains the IPv6 device address found in the incoming packet, a no route to destination ICMPv6  message (type 0, code 3) may be generated,
<!--* a prefix is found, but no devIID matches, a address unreachable ICMPv6  message (type 0, code 3) may be generated,-->
* a device IPv6 address is found, but no port matches,  a port unreachable ICMPv6  message (type 0, code 4) may be generated,</t>

<!-- LT: I suppress type 0 code 0, if the packet arrives to the core SCHC, this means that there is a correct prefix. -->
<!--
  <t>TODO: This assumes that all ports that the Device listens to will be matched by a SCHC rule. Is this the basic assumption of SCHC that all packets that do not match a rule are rejected? If yes, why do have fragmentation also for uncompressed packets?</t>

<t>TODO: discuss the various Type/Code that are expected to be generated in response to various errors.</t>

<section anchor="device-is-the-destination-of-an-icmpv6-error-message" title="Device is the destination of an ICMPv6 error message">

<t>In this situation, we assume that a Device has been configured to send information to a server on the Internet. If this
server becomes no longer accessible, an ICMPv6 message will be generated back towards the Device by either an intermediate router or the destination.
This information can be useful to the Device, for example for reducing the reporting rate in case of periodic reporting of data.
Therefore, we compress the ICMPv6 message using SCHC and forward it to the Device over the LPWAN. We also introduce new MO and CDA
that can be used to test the presence and/or compress the returning payload.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> states that Type can take the values 1 to 4, and Code can be set to values between 0 and 6.
Value is unused for the Destination Unreachable and Time Exceeded messages. It contains the MTU for
the Packet Too Big message and a pointer to the byte causing the error for the Parameter Error message.
Therefore, Value is never expected to be greater than 1280 in LPWAN networks.</t>

<t>The payload is viewed as a field. An unsued field MUST not appear in the compressoin rules.</t>

<t>The source address of the message SHOULD be ignore, since it can be initiated by any router on the path.</t>

<t>The following generic rule can therefore be used to compress all ICMPv6 error messages as defined today.
More specific rules can also be defined to achieve better compression of some error messages.</t>

<t>The Type field can be associated to a matching list [1, 2, 3, 4] and is therefore compressed down to 2
bits. Code can be reduced to 3 bits using the LSB CDA. Value can be sent on 11 bits using the LSB
CDA, but if the Device is known to send smaller packets, then the size of this field can
be further reduced.</t>

<t>The first rule example <xref target="Fig-icmp-error1"/> just sends the ICMP type and code as residue to the device.</t>

this ICMPv6 error message. This information is used to try and identify the SCHC rule that
was used to decompress the offending IPv6 packet. If the rule can be found then the Rule Id
is added at the end of the compressed ICMPv6 message. Otherwise the compressed
packet ends with the compressed Value field.</t>

<t><xref target="RFC4443"/> states that the “ICMPv6 error message MUST include as much
of the IPv6 offending (invoking) packet … as possible”.
In order to comply with this requirement, if there is enough information in the incoming ICMPv6 message for the core SCHC to
identify the rule that has been used to decompress the erroneous IPv6 packet, this Rule Id must be
sent in the compressed ICMPv6 message to the Device.
TODO: the erroneous IPv6 packet header (not just the Rule Id) should be sent back. This includes the Rule Id and the compression residue. This means the SCHC C/D uses the context backwards (in the reverse direction). How does the Device know it must also use the context backwards?</t>

<ul>

      The direction used for matching isthe opposite of the incoming message:
      UP becomes DOWN and DOWN becomes UP.  This MO can be used to test if the Payload
      contained in the ICMPv6 message matches a rule. This means that the 
      original packet, at the origine of the ICMPv6 message, may have been generated
      from the SCHC decompression.</li>
  <li>mo-rule-match: The value contained in the Target Value matches a rule. 
      The direction is the one of the incoming message. This MO is not used

      been included in the Data Model.</li>
</ul>

<t>The Field Value may be compressed by a rule. The result SHOULD be included in the 
SCHC message as a variable length residue. It contains the Rule ID used by the compression,
the residue, the payload and some padding bits since the variable length init is in bytes.</t>
<ul>
  <li>cda-rev-compress-sent:   The direction used for compression  is the opposite of the incoming message:

<!-- References split into informative and normative -->

<!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
  1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
  2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
     (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

  Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
  If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
  directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
  with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
  filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
